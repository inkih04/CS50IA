# CS50AI: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This course, offered by **HarvardX**, provides an introduction to artificial intelligence (AI) using Python. The course covers the foundational principles and techniques of AI, including problem-solving, knowledge representation, machine learning, and natural language processing. It is designed for students with prior programming experience, and it covers a range of topics, including:

- **Search Algorithms** (breadth-first search, depth-first search, A* search)
- **Knowledge Representation** (propositional logic, predicate logic)
- **Optimization** (constraint satisfaction problems, local search)
- **Machine Learning** (supervised learning, unsupervised learning, neural networks)
- **Natural Language Processing** (language models, sentiment analysis)
- **Neural Networks** (feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent networks)
- **Ethics in AI**

By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of AI concepts and will be able to implement AI algorithms to solve real-world problems using Python.
